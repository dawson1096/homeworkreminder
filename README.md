# Homework Reminder

## Overview

Keeping track of all your homeworks, projects and exams can be stressful. It's easy to forget something and miss a deadline. That's where Homework Reminder comes in.

Homework Reminder is a web app that allows users to keep track of all their homeworks/projects and exams. Users can register and login. Once logged in, they can add the different classes they are taking, and a list of homeworks or projects with their due dates. Once they are done with the homework, they can be checked off and will no longer show on their list. They will be able to view their homeworks by class or all of them on a single page. They can also add exam dates which they can check on a seperate page.

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Classes, Homeworks and Exams

* users will have multiple lists of classes
* each list will contain homeworks and exams for that specific class by embedding

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "dwc291",
  hash: // a password hash,
  lists: // an array of references to List documents
}
```

An Example Class List with Embedded Homeworks and Exams:

```javascript
{
  user: // a reference to a User object
  className: "AIT",
  homeworks: [
    { name: "Final Project", dueDate: "04/01/2020", checked: false},
    { name: "Homework 6", dueDate: "04/01/2020", checked: true},
  ],
  exams: [
    { name: "Midterm", date: "03/30/2020", checked: true},
    { name: "Final", date: "05/11/2020", checked: false},
  ]
}
```
